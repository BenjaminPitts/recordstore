Recordstore is my 2nd project and was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Bcrypt, Node, Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB.
This was my first time using databases and servers to create a functional and interactive full-CRUD application. Users can create an account and log in to create/update/delete content. The content can then be accessed by category and has a clean, mobile-friendly layout. There is also a randomly generated album that appears on the index page upon refresh and a link to my portfolio in the footer of the page.<br><br>
