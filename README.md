Recordstore is my 2nd project and was built using HTML, CSS, JS, Node and MongoDB.
This was my first time using databases and servers to create a functional and
interactive full-stack application. Users can create an account, log in and create/update/delete content. The content is then accessed by category and has a clean, responsive and mobile-friendly layout.
