Recordstore app is my 2nd project and was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Bcrypt, Node, Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB.
This was my first time using databases and servers to create a functional and interactive full-CRUD application. Users can create an account and log in to create/update/delete content. The content can then be accessed by category and has a clean, mobile-friendly layout. There is also a randomly generated album that appears on the index page upon refresh and a link to my portfolio in the footer of the page.<br><br>
